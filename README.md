# Chore App

## User Stories
* User
    * I want to be able to make a chores list for my kids.
    * I want to be able to set a point value of the chores so I can have my child can earn points with each chore.
    * I want to have rewards with point values that can be bought with the points earned from doing chores.
    * I want to be able to approve chore completion then give points to child so that
    I know the chore was completed. 
    * I want to see rewards and their cost so that a child  knows what rewards they can earn and how much they cost.
    * I want to see points added up so that a child knows which rewards they can get.
